# Go Advanced

[**Return to Main README**](../README.md)

This learning path covers advanced Go programming concepts, building upon the fundamentals established in the beginner stage.

## What You'll Learn

By following this path, you'll gain a deeper understanding of:

- Concurrency patterns in Go (e.g., worker pools, pipelines, context)
- Networking and building network applications
- Web frameworks (Gin, Echo) for building web apps and APIs
- Dependency injection with Go Wire
- gRPC and Protobuf for inter-service communication
- Testing and profiling Go applications
- Advanced data structures and algorithms

## How to Use This Repository

Each month focuses on a specific advanced topic, with weekly applications designed to reinforce your learning. The code for each week's application is organized in the `cmd` directory, following the naming convention `monthXweekY` (e.g., `month7week1`).

**Explore the Go Standard Library:** As you progress through this advanced learning path, we highly recommend taking the time to familiarize yourself with the Go standard library. It's a valuable resource for learning idiomatic Go and understanding how common tasks are accomplished in the language. You can find the documentation for the standard library here: [Go Standard Library Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/std).
